== ‚öôÔ∏è WordPress Boilerplate

(See https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate)

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs. For example, if your plugin is named 'example-me' then:

* [ ] rename files from plugin-name to example-me
* [ ] change plugin_name to example_me
* [ ] change plugin-name to example-me
* [ ] change Plugin_Name to Example_Me
* [ ] change PLUGIN_NAME_ to EXAMPLE_ME_

It's safe to activate the plugin at this point. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added until you write the code.
